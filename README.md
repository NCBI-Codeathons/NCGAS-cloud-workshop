# NCGAS Hosts NCBI in the Cloud
## November 16-17, 2020

NCBI was excited to be a part of a joint workshop with NCGAS to help attendees become more comfortable using NCBI data and tools in the cloud.  The first day of the workshop provided introductions to doing bioinformatics in the cloud and presented some recently released tools from NCBI. These new tools show some of the tasks where a cloud platform provides the opportunity to do computational biology in ways that would not have been available to researchers without access to large computing facilities.  The second day of the workshop primarily focused on giving attendees the chance to work through exercises and get real-time assistance from NCBI team members.

## Presentations

Session | Slides | Description
-----------| ------------ | ----------
Setup | [Slides](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/NCGAS-cloud-workshop/blob/main/2_Setup.pptx) | A brief overview of some key aspects of getting started on GCP to use NCBI data and tools.

Buckets | [Slides](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/NCGAS-cloud-workshop/blob/main/4_Buckets.pptx) | Learn a bit about what buckets are and how to make and utilize one with Google's Storage product.
BigQuery | [Slides](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/NCGAS-cloud-workshop/blob/main/5_BigQuery.pptx) | An introduction to BigQuery and examples for searching SRA metadata and taxonomy analysis with SQL queries.
RAPT and PGAP | [Slides](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/NCGAS-cloud-workshop/blob/main/PGAP_RAPT_intro_NCGAS_v2.pdf) | Learn about the RAPT and PGAP assembly and annotation pipelines for prokaryotice genomes and how to run these tools.
ElasticBLAST | [Slides](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/NCGAS-cloud-workshop/blob/main/elastic-blast-ncgas-presentation.pptx) | The search algorithmn BLAST can now be launched in the cloud to run bigger sequence searchs faster than ever.


## Exercises
In addition to presentations, here are the workshop exercises to reinforce the information and exapand your knowledge on the tools.
*Some exercises refer to a Service Account and GCP Project that were specific for this workshop.  After completion of the workshop you will need to use your own Service Account and Project.*
